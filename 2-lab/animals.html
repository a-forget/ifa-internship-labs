          Although fishers are competent tree climbers, they spend most of their

          habitats. They have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of
          the boreal forest, but are also common in mixed-hardwood and conifer
          forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with
          greater than 80% coverage and avoid areas with less than 50% coverage.
          Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests.
