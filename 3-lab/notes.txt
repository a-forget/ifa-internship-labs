6. Titan
7. Enceladus

1. The Moon - Sea of Tranquility - Tranquility Base - Apollo 11 landing site
Location
    Orbits Earth
Average distance from Earth
    ~384,400 km
Must-see landmarks
    Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's footsteps; the Earth; the Sun
Estimated time for one-way trip
    About 3 days
One interesting fact or reason why you want to go there
    To see where Neil and Buzz landed and to experience all that they experienced

2. Mars - Olympus Mons; Valles Marineris
Location
    Mars
Average distance from Earth
    ~228 million km
Must-see landmarks
    Olympus Mons; Valles Marineris
Estimated time for one-way trip
    About 9 months
One interesting fact or reason why you want to go there
    While Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earthâ€™s dry land due to its topology. Mars features both the tallest and largest volcano in the Solar System (Olympus Mons, 22 - 26 km high, or 2.5x Mount Everest above sea level) as well as the deepest canyon (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km long, 600 km wide, 8 km deep)

3. Europa - geysers and liquid water
Location
    Sixth-closest of Jupiter's moons
Average distance from Earth
    ~715 million km
Must-see landmarks
    Jupiter at the sub-Jovian point; geysers; smooth, icy surface
Estimated time for one-way trip
    6 to 7 years
One interesting fact or reason why you want to go there
    Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System due to its water ocean beneath the surface, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life.

4. Titan - surface lakes of methane and ethane
Location
    Twenty-third-closest of Saturn's moons; second-furthest of its major moons
Average distance from Earth
    ~1.4 billion km
Must-see landmarks
    Large surface lakes of composed of methane and ethane
    Cryovolcanoes
Estimated time for one-way trip
    8 to 12 years
One interesting fact or reason why you want to go there
    It is the only known object in space (other than Earth) on which there is clear evidence that stable surface bodies of liquid exist.

5. The Sun
Location
    The center of the Solar System
Average distance from Earth
    ~150 million km
Must-see landmarks
    The sun
Estimated time for one-way trip
    About 7 months
One interesting fact or reason why you want to go there
    To get to see the sun's surface up close, from a distance of ~6.1 million km

6. Enceladus - geysers, liquid water, Saturn's rings
Location
    Fifteenth closest of Saturn's moons; second-closest of its major moons
Average distance from Earth
    ~1.4 billion km
Must-see landmarks
    Saturn's rings; geysers
Estimated time for one-way trip
    8 to 12 years
One interesting fact or reason why you want to go there
    Its polar geysers shoot water vapour, salt, ice, and other materials, into space at a rate of 440 lbs per second

7. The International Space Station
Location
    In orbit around Earth
Average distance from Earth
    ~400 km from Earth
Must-see landmarks
    Earth, sunrise and sunset
Estimated time for one-way trip
    Current average is about 24 hours
One interesting fact or reason why you want to go there
    To get to see firsthand everything that I've read about the experience from astronauts
