    +++ Instructions +++
"You're building a currency converter that not only converts USD to CAD but
also provides helpful comparisons to previous exchange rates."


    +++ Computational Thinking +++
Decomposition:
Breaking down the task into smaller steps (getting input,
converting, calculating, comparing, displaying).

- Get input for USD
- Convert USD to CAD
- Get values for previous exchange rates
- Compare CAD value to previous rates
- Display CAD result and comparisons


Pattern Recognition:
Recognizing the patterns in conversion and
comparison.

- [Not a lot of repetition involved here]


Abstraction:
Using variables to represent amounts, rates, and comparison
results.

- exRate = exchange rate
- usd = input
- cad = usd * exRate
- compare1 = a previous exchange rate
- compare2 = another previous exchange rate
- calculate cad values at various exchange rates
- display cad values and various exchanges rates, along with comparisons


Algorithm Design:
Creating a step-by-step plan for the logic.
