          My name is Kvothe. <br /><br />

          I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned
          down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left
          with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at
          a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by
          moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to
          Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.
          <br /><br />
          You may have heard of me.

        <p>
          A moving story of father-son reconciliation told by a charismatic
          Aboriginal star. <br /><br />
          When his father was given a diagnosis of terminal cancer, Winnipeg
          broadcaster and musician Wab Kinew decided to spend a year
          reconnecting with the accomplished but distant aboriginal man who'd
          raised him. The Reason You Walk spans that 2012 year, chronicling
          painful moments in the past and celebrating renewed hopes and dreams
          for the future. As Kinew revisits his own childhood in Winnipeg and on
          a reserve in Northern Ontario, he learns more about his father's
          traumatic childhood at residential school.

        <p>
          When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl
          spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her
          right to an education. <br /><br />
          On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the
          ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while
          riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive.
          <br /><br />
          Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an
          extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the
          halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a
          global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace
          Prize laureate.

        <p>
          Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Daniel Kahneman
          explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is
          slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both
          systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary
          capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive
          influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices.
          Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he
          shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the
          benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind
          with the standard model of the rational economic agent.
