Imagine Your Bookstore: Spend a few minutes brainstorming details about your fictional bookstore. Consider:

o Name: Come up with a creative and catchy name.

    My Reads

o Specialization: What kind of books does it sell? (e.g., new releases, used books, specific genres like sci-fi or mystery)

    It sells books that I've either read or want to read

o Atmosphere: What's the vibe of the store? (e.g., cozy and traditional, modern and minimalist, quirky and eclectic)

    Cozy, traditional, and minimalist

o Sections: What sections or features would it have? (e.g., new arrivals, staff picks, events calendar, online store)
