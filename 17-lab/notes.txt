Variables:
- base fare 
- distance traveled
- rate per x unit (time and/or distance)
- any additional fees

Decomposition:
- get input
- calculate distance traveled
- calculate time elapsed
- add fees
- return total

Pattern recognition:
- base fare
- distance traveled
- rate per x
- additional fees

[Lab instructions further specify "rate" is per distance, not time]
Abstraction:
Variables:
- baseFare
- distanceTraveled
- ratePerKM
- ratePerMinute
- additionalFees

Algorithm:
totalFare = baseFare + additionalFees + (distanceTraveled * ratePerKm)
